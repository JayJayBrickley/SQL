In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 



/* How many orders were placed in January?*/

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/* How many of those orders were for an iPhone?*/
 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/* Select the customer account numbers for all the 
orders that were placed in February.*/

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers C
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales F
ON C.order_id = F.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> "Order ID";

/*Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, 
and what was the price?*/

SELECT distinct Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price asc LIMIT 1;

/*What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
(Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold 
and the price of the products).*/

SELECT orderid, quantity, price, product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT SUM(quantity), price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price;

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/*Which products were sold in February at 
548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, 
and what was the total revenue?*/

SELECT 
SUM(Quantity),
Product,
SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

/*How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/

select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*#1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in 
January, and how many orders did they each receive?*/

SELECT distinct location, COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%' 
AND length (orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location 
HAVING COUNT(ORDERid)>2;

/* How many of each type of headphones 
were sold in February*/

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product

SELECT AVG(Quantity/Price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales F
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers C

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*What was the average quantity of products purchased 
per account in February?*/

select sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/* Which product brought in the most revenue in January 
and how much revenue did it bring in total? */

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(quantity*price) desc
LIMIT 1
